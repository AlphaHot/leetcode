/**
 * = 16. 3Sum Closest
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/description/[3Sum Closest - LeetCode]
 *
 * Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers
 * in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three
 * integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 *
 * .Example:
 * [source]
 * ----
 * Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.
 *
 * The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
