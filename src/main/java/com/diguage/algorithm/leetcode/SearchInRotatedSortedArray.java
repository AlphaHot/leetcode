 * = 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/[Search in Rotated Sorted Array - LeetCode]
 *
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
 * to you beforehand.
 *
 * (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).
 *
 * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its
 * index, otherwise return `-1`.
 *
 * You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
 *
 * Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
 *
 * .Example 1:
 * [source]
 * ----
 * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
 * Output: 4
 * ----
 *
 * .Example 2:
 * [source]
 * ----
 * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
 * Output: -1
 * ----
