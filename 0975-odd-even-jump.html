<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are given an integer array <code>A</code>.  From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps.  The (1st, 3rd, 5th, &#8230;&#8203;) jumps in the series are called <em>odd numbered jumps</em>, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, &#8230;&#8203;) jumps in the series are called <em>even numbered jumps</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may from index <code>i</code> jump forward to index <code>&lt;font face="monospace"&gt;j</code> (with <code>i &lt; j</code>) in the following way:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>During odd numbered jumps (ie. jumps 1, 3, 5, &#8230;&#8203;), you jump to the index &lt;font face="monospace"&gt;j such that <code>A[i] &#8656; A[j]</code> and <code>A[j]</code> is the smallest possible value.  If there are multiple such indexes <code>&lt;font face="monospace"&gt;j</code>, you can only jump to the <strong>smallest</strong> such index <code>&lt;font face="monospace"&gt;j</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During even numbered jumps (ie. jumps 2, 4, 6, &#8230;&#8203;), you jump to the index &lt;font face="monospace"&gt;j such that <code>A[i] &gt;= A[j]</code> and <code>A[j]</code> is the largest possible value.  If there are multiple such indexes <code>&lt;font face="monospace"&gt;j</code>, you can only jump to the <strong>smallest</strong> such index <code>&lt;font face="monospace"&gt;j</code>.</p>

<p>(It may be the case that for some index <code>&lt;font face="monospace"&gt;i,</code> there are no legal jumps.)</p>

<p>A starting index is <em>good</em> if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index <code>A.length - 1</code>) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once.)</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [10,13,12,14,15]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
From starting index i = 0, we can jump to i = 2 (since A[2] is the smallest among A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4] that is greater or equal to A[0]), then we can't jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can jump to i = 3, then we can't jump any more.
From starting index i = 3, we can jump to i = 4, so we've reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we've reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indexes (i = 3, i = 4) where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [2,3,1,1,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:

During our 1st jump (odd numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because A[1] is the smallest value in (A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4]) that is greater than or equal to A[0].

During our 2nd jump (even numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because A[2] is the largest value in (A[2], A[3], A[4]) that is less than or equal to A[1].  A[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3.

During our 3rd jump (odd numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because A[3] is the smallest value in (A[3], A[4]) that is greater than or equal to A[2].

We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.

In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indexes (i = 1, i = 3, i = 4) where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.</pre>
