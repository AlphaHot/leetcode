https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/[LeetCode - Max Consecutive Ones III]

Given an array `A` of 0s and 1s, we may change up to `K` values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

 


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *A = <span id="example-input-1-1">[1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = <span id="example-input-1-2">2
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">6
*Explanation: *
[1,1,1,0,0,[.underline]#*1*,1,1,1,1,*1*#]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *A = <span id="example-input-2-1">[0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = <span id="example-input-2-2">3
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">10
*Explanation: *
[0,0,[.underline]#1,1,*1*,*1*,1,1,1,*1*,1,1#,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

----

 

*Note:*


. `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
. `0 <= K <= A.length`
. `A[i]` is `0` or `1`
