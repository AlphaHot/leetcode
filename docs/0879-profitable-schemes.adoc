== 879. Profitable Schemes

https://leetcode.com/problems/profitable-schemes/[LeetCode - Profitable Schemes]

There are G people in a gang, and a list of various crimes they could commit.

The `i`-th crime generates a `profit[i]` and requires `group[i]` gang members to participate.

If a gang member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.

Let's call a _profitable scheme_ any subset of these crimes that generates at least `P` profit, and the total number of gang members participating in that subset of crimes is at most G.

How many schemes can be chosen?  Since the answer may be very large, *return it modulo* `10^9 + 7`.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *G = <span id="example-input-1-1">5, P = <span id="example-input-1-2">3, group = <span id="example-input-1-3">[2,2], profit = <span id="example-input-1-4">[2,3]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">2
*Explanation: *
To make a profit of at least 3, the gang could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
In total, there are 2 schemes.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *G = <span id="example-input-2-1">10, P = <span id="example-input-2-2">5, group = <span id="example-input-2-3">[2,3,5], profit = <span id="example-input-2-4">[6,7,8]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">7
*Explanation: *
To make a profit of at least 5, the gang could commit any crimes, as long as they commit one.
There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).

*Note:*


. `1 <= G <= 100`
. `0 <= P <= 100`
. `1 <= group[i] <= 100`
. `0 <= profit[i] <= 100`
. `1 <= group.length = profit.length <= 100`
