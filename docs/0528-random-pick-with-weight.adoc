== 528. Random Pick with Weight

https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/[LeetCode - Random Pick with Weight]

Given an array `w` of positive integers, where `w[i]` describes the weight of index `i`, write a function `pickIndex` which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:


. `1 <= w.length <= 10000`
. `1 <= w[i] <= 10^5`
. `pickIndex` will be called at most `10000` times.


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: 
*<span id="example-input-1-1">["Solution","pickIndex"]
<span id="example-input-1-2">[[[1]],[]]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">[null,0]
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: 
*<span id="example-input-2-1">["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
<span id="example-input-2-2">[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">[null,0,1,1,1,0]
----


*Explanation of Input Syntax:*

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. `Solution`'s constructor has one argument, the array `w`. `pickIndex` has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
