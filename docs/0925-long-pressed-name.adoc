== 925. Long Pressed Name

https://leetcode.com/problems/long-pressed-name/[LeetCode - Long Pressed Name]

Your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a character `c`, the key might get _long pressed_, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the `typed` characters of the keyboard.  Return `True` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *name = <span id="example-input-1-1">"alex", typed = <span id="example-input-1-2">"aaleex"
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">true
*Explanation: *'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *name = <span id="example-input-2-1">"saeed", typed = <span id="example-input-2-2">"ssaaedd"
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">false
*Explanation: *'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *name = <span id="example-input-3-1">"leelee", typed = <span id="example-input-3-2">"lleeelee"

----


*Example 4:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *name = <span id="example-input-4-1">"laiden", typed = <span id="example-input-4-2">"laiden"
*Output: *<span id="example-output-4">true
*Explanation: *It's not necessary to long press any character.

*Note:*


. `name.length <= 1000`
. `typed.length <= 1000`
. The characters of `name` and `typed` are lowercase letters.
