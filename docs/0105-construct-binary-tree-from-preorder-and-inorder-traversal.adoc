== 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/[LeetCode - Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal]

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

*Note:*


You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
----

Return the following binary tree:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
----
