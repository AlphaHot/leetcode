== 1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-words-that-can-be-formed-by-characters/[LeetCode - Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters]

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`.

A string is _good_ if it can be formed by characters from `chars` (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in `words`.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *words = <span id="example-input-1-1">["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = <span id="example-input-1-2">"atach"
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">6
*Explanation: *
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *words = <span id="example-input-2-1">["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = <span id="example-input-2-2">"welldonehoneyr"
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">10
*Explanation: *
The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
----

 

*Note:*


. `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
. `1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100`
. All strings contain lowercase English letters only.
