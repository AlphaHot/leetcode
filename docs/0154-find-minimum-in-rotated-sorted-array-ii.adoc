== 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/[LeetCode - Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II]

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* [1,3,5]
*Output:* 1
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* [2,2,2,0,1]
*Output:* 0
----

*Note:*


* This is a follow up problem to <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/">Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array</a>.
* Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
