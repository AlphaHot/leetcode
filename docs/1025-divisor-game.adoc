== 1025. Divisor Game

https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/[LeetCode - Divisor Game]

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number `N` on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a _move_ consisting of:


* Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < N` and `N % x == 0`.
* Replacing the number `N` on the chalkboard with `N - x`.


Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return `True` if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
