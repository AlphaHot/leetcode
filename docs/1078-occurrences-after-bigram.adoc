https://leetcode.com/problems/occurrences-after-bigram/[LeetCode - Occurrences After Bigram]

Given words `first` and `second`, consider occurrences in some `text` of the form "`first second third`", where `second` comes immediately after `first`, and `third` comes immediately after `second`.

For each such occurrence, add "`third`" to the answer, and return the answer.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *text = <span id="example-input-1-1">"alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = <span id="example-input-1-2">"a", second = <span id="example-input-1-3">"good"
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">["girl","student"]
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *text = <span id="example-input-2-1">"we will we will rock you", first = <span id="example-input-2-2">"we", second = <span id="example-input-2-3">"will"
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">["we","rock"]
----

 

*Note:*


. `1 <= text.length <= 1000`
. `text` consists of space separated words, where each word consists of lowercase English letters.
. `1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10`
. `first` and `second` consist of lowercase English letters.
