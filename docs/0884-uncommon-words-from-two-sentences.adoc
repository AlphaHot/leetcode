https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/[LeetCode - Uncommon Words from Two Sentences]

We are given two sentences `A` and `B`.  (A _sentence_ is a string of space separated words.  Each _word_ consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is _uncommon_ if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words. 

You may return the list in any order.

 





*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *A = <span id="example-input-1-1">"this apple is sweet", B = <span id="example-input-1-2">"this apple is sour"
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">["sweet","sour"]
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *A = <span id="example-input-2-1">"apple apple", B = <span id="example-input-2-2">"banana"
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">["banana"]
----

 

*Note:*


. `0 <= A.length <= 200`
. `0 <= B.length <= 200`
. `A` and `B` both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
