== 652. Find Duplicate Subtrees

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-duplicate-subtrees/[LeetCode - Find Duplicate Subtrees]

Given a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any *one* of them.

Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with same node values.

*Example 1: *

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /   / \
    4   2   4
       /
      4
----

The following are two duplicate subtrees:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
      2
     /
    4
----

and

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    4
----
Therefore, you need to return above trees' root in the form of a list.
