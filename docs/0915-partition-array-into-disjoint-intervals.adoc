== 915. Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals

https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-disjoint-intervals/[LeetCode - Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals]

Given an array `A`, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays `left` and `right` so that:


* Every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
* `left` and `right` are non-empty.
* `left` has the smallest possible size.


Return the *length* of `left` after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *<span id="example-input-1-1">[5,0,3,8,6]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">3
*Explanation: *left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *<span id="example-input-2-1">[1,1,1,0,6,12]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">4
*Explanation: *left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]
----

 


*Note:*


* `2 <= A.length <= 30000`
* `0 <= A[i] <= 10^6`
* It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition `A` as described.
