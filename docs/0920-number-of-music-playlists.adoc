== 920. Number of Music Playlists

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-music-playlists/[LeetCode - Number of Music Playlists]

Your music player contains `N` different songs and she wants to listen to `L`* *(not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that:


* Every song is played at least once
* A song can only be played again only if `K` other songs have been played


Return the number of possible playlists.  *As the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`*.

 




*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *N = <span id="example-input-1-1">3, L = <span id="example-input-1-2">3, K = <span id="example-input-1-3">1
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">6
*Explanation*: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *N = <span id="example-input-2-1">2, L = <span id="example-input-2-2">3, K = <span id="example-input-2-3">0
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">6
<span id="example-output-1">*Explanation*: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *N = <span id="example-input-3-1">2, L = <span id="example-input-3-2">3, K = <span id="example-input-3-3">1
*Output: *<span id="example-output-3">2
*Explanation*: There are 2 possible playlists. [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2]
----



 

*Note:*


* `0 <= K < N <= L <= 100`
