== 1035. Uncrossed Lines

https://leetcode.com/problems/uncrossed-lines/[LeetCode - Uncrossed Lines]

We write the integers of `A` and `B` (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

Now, we may draw _connecting lines_: a straight line connecting two numbers `A[i]` and `B[j]` such that:


* `A[i] == B[j]`;
* The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.


Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each number can only belong to one connecting line.

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

*Input: *A = <span id="example-input-1-1">[1,4,2], B = <span id="example-input-1-2">[1,2,4]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">2
*Explanation: *We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from A[1]=4 to B[2]=4 will intersect the line from A[2]=2 to B[1]=2.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *A = <span id="example-input-2-1">[2,5,1,2,5], B = <span id="example-input-2-2">[10,5,2,1,5,2]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">3

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *A = <span id="example-input-3-1">[1,3,7,1,7,5], B = <span id="example-input-3-2">[1,9,2,5,1]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-3">2
----

 



*Note:*


* `1 <= A.length <= 500`
* `1 <= B.length <= 500`
* `<font face="monospace">1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2000`
