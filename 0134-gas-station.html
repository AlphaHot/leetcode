*Explanation:

Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.</pre>

<strong>Output:</strong> -1

*Explanation:
*You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.</pre>

 *
 * There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is `gas[i]`.
 *
 * You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 *
 * Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
 *
 * *Note:*
 *
 * * If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
 * * Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
 * * Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
